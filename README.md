# hello-world
My first Repository
I am a current Computer Science major at Regis University.  I have a few more CS courses to take and a few more core/elective courses to obtain my CS degree.  I am a bit worried about my options in the city in which I currently live; therefore, I am working through this "boot camp" in order to increase my chances at a job.  

I am 50 years old and will be 51 when I graduate, which also give me concern as to my chances of obtaining a job in the computer field.

This is my first attempt and assignment on GitHub.
